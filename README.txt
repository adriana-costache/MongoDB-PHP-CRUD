This project is about testing some CRUD functionality on a PHP platform connected to MongoDB. 

Initially I have managed to build a registration form using PHP and MongoDB and well a PHP which shows all records stored.
I would like to be able to perform the other CRUD operations and also enhance the functionality of the first two.
